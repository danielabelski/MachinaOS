"""Wave 12 A6: Temporal-native event dispatch.

One public function — :func:`emit` — takes a :class:`WorkflowEvent` and
routes it to:

1. **Running consumer workflows** via Temporal Visibility query +
   ``Client.signal_workflow``. Workflows tag themselves with the
   ``EventType`` Search Attribute when they're started; this dispatch
   finds them via ``ListWorkflows(query="EventType='X' AND
   ExecutionStatus='Running'")`` and signals each.

2. **In-process FastAPI WebSocket clients** via direct
   ``status_broadcaster.broadcast()`` call. Worker + WS pool share
   memory + event loop, so no IPC hop is needed (the ``main.py``
   lifespan schedules ``services.temporal.lifecycle.run_temporal_lifecycle``
   as an in-process task, and that task starts the workers).

No EventDispatchWorkflow, no Redis Streams, no DLQ table. Temporal's
Visibility + Signal API + Event History provide the durability primitives
this function depends on; everything else is a thin pass-through.

Behind ``Settings.event_framework_enabled`` (default on since Wave 12).
When disabled, :func:`emit` is a no-op pass-through that returns the
envelope unchanged. That is no longer a working rollback: most canary
producers call only :func:`emit` (no ``event_waiter.dispatch``), so with
the flag off their deployed triggers never fire and the WS broadcast
below stops too. See docs-internal/event_framework.md, "Rollback (known
gap)".
